    The thing is quite simple I am an undertaker who undertakes challenges and simply just pushes through them so yeah that might be a thing which I am proud of but that's certainly not the reason why I dont try because we fail and then a wise men asked me that why do we fall sir? and he himself answered "so that we can learn to pick ourselves up!".I was totally pricked up by this line we knew it but we never acknowledged it we always thought that we are useless but that's not. Everytime we fail we learn something extremely valuable but I don't know why we never acknowledge it.Why is it so?Have you ever questioned.No.We are always in a race .Always in a hurry .The most important stuff to be made was to set up ahead od the  pasr memebers the numbers were not past effective but I swear if you work hard you could do anything without any doubt.Yeah here it goes. Today might be the things are not well but one day they  will be and you will make it happen.I swear bro you will make it happen one day <i class="fa fa-server" aria-hidden="true"></i>
